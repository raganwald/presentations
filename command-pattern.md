# First-Class Commands
### an unexpectedly fertile design pattern

![](images/command/plates.jpg)

---

Why do we care about first-class commands?

^ Placeholder for some overview talk

^ Let's get started

---

![](images/command/underwood.jpg)

## the canonical example:

# mutable data

---

```javascript
class Buffer {
  constructor (text = '') { this.text = text; }

  replaceWith (replacement, from = 0, to = this.text.length) {
    this.text = this.text.slice(0, from) +
                  replacement +
                  this.text.slice(to);
    return this;
  }

  toString () { return this.text; }
}
```

---

```javascript
let buffer = new Buffer();

buffer.replaceWith(
  "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog"
);
buffer.replaceWith("fast", 4, 9);
buffer.replaceWith("canine", 40, 43);
 //=> The fast brown fox jumped over the lazy canine
```

---

## `buffer`
# is an object

---

# we treat objects as first-class entities

![](images/command/red-rollers.jpg)

^ https://www.flickr.com/photos/mwichary/2406482529

---

## `replaceWith`
# is a method

---

# we can treat methods as first-class entities

![](images/command/press.jpg)

^ https://www.flickr.com/photos/tompagenet/8580371564

^ e.g. decorators

---

## `buffer.replaceWith("fast", 4, 9)`
# is an invocation

---

# what does it mean to treat an invocation as a first-class entity?

![](images/command/print-room.jpg)

^ https://www.flickr.com/photos/ooocha/2869485136

^ Talk about invocations being ephemeral and tied up with mutable state, some visible, some hidden.

---

# store it

![](images/command/hp2600n.jpg)

^ https://www.flickr.com/photos/oskay/2550938136

---

```javascript
class Edit {
  constructor (buffer, {replacement, from, to}) {
    this.buffer = buffer;
    Object.assign(this, {replacement, from, to});
  }

  doIt () {
    this.buffer.text =
      this.buffer.text.slice(0, this.from) +
      this.replacement +
      this.buffer.text.slice(this.to);
    return this.buffer;
  }
}
```

---

```javascript
class Buffer {
  constructor (text = '') { this.text = text; }

  replaceWith (replacement, from = 0, to = this.text.length) {
    return new Edit(this, {replacement, from, to});
  }

  toString () { return this.text; }
}
```

---

```javascript
let buffer = new Buffer(), jobQueue = [];

jobQueue.push(
  buffer.replaceWith(
    "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog"
  )
);
jobQueue.push( buffer.replaceWith("fast", 4, 9) );
jobQueue.push( buffer.replaceWith("canine", 40, 43) );

while (jobQueue.length > 0) {
  jobQueue.shift().doIt();
}
 //=> The fast brown fox jumped over the lazy canine
```

^ Presto, a job queue!

---

# query it

![](images/command/keyboard.jpg)

^ https://www.flickr.com/photos/baccharus/4474584940

---

```javascript
class Edit {

  netChange () {
    return this.from - this.to + this.replacement.length;
  }
}
```

---

```javascript
let buffer = new Buffer();

buffer.replaceWith(
    "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog"
).netChange();
 //=> 44

buffer.replaceWith("fast", 4, 9).netChange();
 //=> -1
```

---

# transform it

![](images/command/stamps.jpg)

^ https://www.flickr.com/photos/micurs/4906349993

---

```javascript
class Edit {

  reversed () {
    let replacement = this.buffer.text.slice(this.from, this.to),
        from = this.from,
        to = from + this.replacement.length;
    return new Edit(buffer, {replacement, from, to});
  }
}
```

---

```javascript
let buffer = new Buffer(
  "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog"
);

let doer = buffer.replaceWith("fast", 4, 9),
    undoer = doer.reversed();

doer.doIt();
  //=> The fast brown fox jumped over the lazy dog

undoer.doIt();
  //=> The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog
```

---

```javascript

---

# `redo`

![](images/command/simple.jpg)

---

```javascript
class Buffer {

  redo () {
